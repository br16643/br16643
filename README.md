- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Braden
I graduated for Iowa State University in 2017 with a degree in Electrical Engineering.
I began at Vermeer on the Controls team as an Embedded Hardware Designer. Some of my credits are the Damage Defense, Strike Alert Tester. Any remote the uses a Laird radio was redesigned by me, also the Vermeer Functionality and Range Tester Rev. 2 was my baby.

I joined the On Machine Platform team in March 2022, and have been learning every day since.

In my spare time I play video games, board games, build lego, rock climbing, and wood working. Ask me about my favorite board games. (Scythe, Cthulu: Death May Die)
